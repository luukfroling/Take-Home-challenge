# Take-Home-challenge

I decided to present the notebook files for this take-home challenge in a MyST Book. The MyST framework allows me to showcase the notebooks in a structured, cleaner, and more visually appealing format compared to plain Jupyter notebooks.

I chose this format as over the past two years I worked as a developer on an open education platform focused on making university textbooks more accessible to students. During that time, I became very familiar with the MyST and JupyterBook frameworks, so using them here felt like a natural fit.

While writing some of the code for this challenge, I often referred to the skimage and pytorch documentation. As a result, some snippets are quite similar to the examples there. To keep the focus on my problem-solving approach, experimental design, and synthesis of findings, I have chosen to initially hide certain code cells. These can be revealed at any time by clicking the “source” dropdown, displaying the code that produced the output shown directly below. Some of the output cells are hidden in a similar way, and can be shown by expanding the "output" dropdown.
